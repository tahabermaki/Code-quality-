Bert Model Use :
The Bert model is used to classify programming code comments into:
good comments (useful ==> adds explanations)
or a \text{bad comment}: Like useless lines of code transformed into comments
PS: the comment is always preceded by a hashtag #

This help's us determine if the software follows good programming manners and thus whether the code is of good quality or not
